                James Thomason Building
            </span>
            <p>
                The main administrative building is a gentle reminder of the glorious past of the institute. Its
                grandeur establishes the institute's importance in technical education and research work on global
                scale. The noble edifice looks across the plains towards the snowy caps of the Himalayas. Built in
                renaissance style, its construction began in 1852. Several constructions were added to it along the
                timeline.

                The building's quadrangle housed the teaching facilities along with the administration for about a
                century. The lush green lawns in front provide perfect ambience of an evening walk and the building
                leaves an indelible impression on everyone who sees it.
